He takes the side of Ahad Ha'am, and call upon him and his fellows to join in a new national-interpretive initiative. In Alexandrov's opinion the contradiction between religious life and the sciences and enlightenment finds its dialectic culmination in Nationalism, which embodies authenticity, morality and rationality. National life will replace religious life, which hinges solely upon reward and punishment. Like Ahad Ha'am, Alexandrov combines a striving to modernize Judaism with a call to return to the traditional sources which carry its national values.
